# The Unsplash Dataset

The Unsplash Dataset is made up of over 200,000+ contributing global photographers and data sourced from hundreds of millions of searches across a nearly unlimited number of uses and contexts. Due to the breadth of intent and semantics contained within the Unsplash dataset, it enables new opportunities for research and learning.

The Unsplash Dataset is offered in two datasets:

- the Lite dataset: available for commercial and noncommercial usage, containing 25k nature-themed Unsplash photos, 25k keywords, and 1M searches
- the Full dataset: available for noncommercial usage, containing 2M+ high-quality Unsplash photos, 5M keywords, and over 250M searches

As the Unsplash library continues to grow, we’ll release updates to the dataset with new fields and new images, with each subsequent release being [semantically versioned](https://semver.org/).

We welcome any feedback regarding the content of the datasets or their format. With your input, we hope to close the gap between the data we provide and the data that you would like to leverage. You can [open an issue](https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/new/choose) to report a problem or to let us know what you would like to see in the next release of the datasets.
