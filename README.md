# MultiModalStory Demo - based on VISStarter

## Client

Uses Vue 3.0 + Typescript.

Consider converting main page into components, it'll be easier to keep track of

(development)

```
cd client
npm i
npm run serve
```

## Backend

(development)

```
uvicorn backend.server:app --reload
```

# Notes
- To interactively hit backend routes, go to `localhost:8000/docs` (i.e., the server running the backend not the Vue server)
